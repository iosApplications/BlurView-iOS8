BlurView-iOS8

This tutorial comtains different default Blur Effects available in iOS 8. 

- Dark Blur Effect 
- Light Blur Effect 
- Extra Light Blur Effect

To get a Blur or Vibrancy effect on any given view, add a UIVisualEffectView to it. Once added to the view hierarchy, add any subviews to the contentView of a UIVisualEffectView.

Vibrancy effect is required only when we add clear text or clear color image on blur view, else simple UIVisualEffectView with blurEffect it self is enough.
